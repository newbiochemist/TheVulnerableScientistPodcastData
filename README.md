# The VulnerableScientist Podcast Data
This is data of the listenership of the the vulnerable scientist podcast

It is clear that there are more listeners from USA and Kenya than any other country with US leading and heading to 1000 downloads.

This could be because of popularity of listeners and Scientists from USA that could have found it on twitter or maybe on linkedin. 

Since the podcast is shared on my platform, Sarah Nyakeri on Linkedin, which half of the followers come from Kenya, then that could explain the popularity among kenyans.
